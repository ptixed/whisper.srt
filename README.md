Japanese subs avaliable on the Internet most often do not exactly match spoken contents of shows so I made a scipt that will generate ones that will. `whisper` used here gives almost perfect trascriptions, more impressive than I expected.

This scirpt can also be used for other languages.

Depedencies: `ffmpeg` and  https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper (with `CUDA` unless you are really patient).
